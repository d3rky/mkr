STATEMENT OF THE TASK
=====================

Before building the code, describe your task in main.cpp:
 - set descretize steps,
 - create boundary conditions,
 - place boundary conditions to the plate,
 - create a solver you need.

BUILD THE CODE
==============

Build the code using make utility:
    make

For building debug code use:
    make debug

RUNNING
=======

After building file build/mkr would be created. Run programm:
    build/mkr

After that you'll have a file build/default.output with a temperature of your
matrice.

In directory src there is a Maxima script (src/draw_plot.wxm) to create a diagram.
